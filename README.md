### 🧑‍💻 Note on the use of [Coder](https://coder.com/) CDE ☁️

To help people with their IDE configuration we use Coder during the workshop, this is not a mandatory step, but it will help you to have a better experience.
Ask to have the URL where you can start a Coder workspace giving the AI workshop template.
You can open your VSCode instance in your browser, choose _code-server_ button or with a ssh tunnel on your local VSCode, choose _VS Code Desktop_.
