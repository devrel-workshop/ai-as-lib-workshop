#### Abstract
Artificial intelligence and LLM are beginning to be part of our personal and professional lives.
We are used to using them regularly, but our developments are different.
Integrating them can seem more complex than using them in our daily lives.
Do I need to learn a new language or a new stack?
During this workshop, we will give you everything you need to start your journey through AI without leaving your preferred language: Java, JavaScript or Python.
You will learn how to use the Frameworks of the moment (LangChain, LangChain4j, ...) but also the tools that make your life easier so that as soon as you return to your favorite application, integrating AI within it is no longer a fear but an action as simple as adding a third library.
And to make your life easier, just bring your computer and a web browser, and we'll take care of the rest to build you a small-scale development environment using CDE.
